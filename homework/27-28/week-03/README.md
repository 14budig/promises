# Week 3 Homework

The homeworks and readings below are intended to prepare you for the next day's lectures. Please complete them first.

If you have any remaining time, please complete/review the exercises from dawn and dusk lectures. You can also review the morning drills.

Please refer to the [Instructions for Submitting Homework](/how-to/homework-submission.md).


## Day 1

### Afternoon exercises

Complete the [afternoon exercises](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/blob/master/02-express-mongo-crud/express-params-queries/27-28/exercises.md).

### REST API homework

1. Read [the top comment in this discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming) about what REST is (and the rest of the discussion if you're curious). We do not expect you to deeply understand all of the terminology here, we want this to serve as an introduction.

1. Read [practices 1-4 and 9 on this blog post](http://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2014/06/05/10-best-practices-for-better-restful-api/) about best practices for REST.

1. Fork and clone [this RESTful API exercise](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/restful-api-exercises) and make a pull request to submit it.

### Middleware homework

1. Read [these notes](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/blob/master/02-express-mongo-crud/express-params-queries/27-28/middleware_reading.md) introducing the concept of middleware.

Please use any remaining time to complete and review the exercises from dawn & dusk:

* [This morning's notes](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/tree/master/02-express-mongo-crud/intro-express/27-28)
* [This morning's express practice exercise](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/express-intro)
* [This afternoon's notes](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/tree/master/02-express-mongo-crud/express-params-queries/27-28)
* [This afternoon's exercises](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/blob/master/02-express-mongo-crud/express-params-queries/27-28/exercises.md)

## Day 2

1. [Continue today's lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/test-driven-todo-api).  If you are showing all todos on the index, creating new todos, and deleting todos, you've done great!  Regardless of how far you get submit with a pull request, and remember comments to let us know comfort, and completeness.
2. Looking forward: Read over [mongoose's getting started guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/).
  * Also read the first few sections of Mongoose's [guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html), up through the section on creating a model. Figure out a brief summary of what a mongoose _schema_ is, what a mongoose _model_ is, and how they're different.   
  * Get a feel for the basic syntax mongoose uses to make a new document, save the document, and find documents later.



Please use any remaining time to complete and review the exercises from dawn & dusk.


## Day 3

1. Continue working on [the lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/mongoose-books-app) from today and complete sprints 1 and 2. Because of the cloning confusions today, we were unable to fork and won't expect pull request submissions.
1. Reading: Take a look at the documentation for all of the mongoose methods [listed in the morning module](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/tree/master/02-express-mongo-crud/mongoose-intro/27-28#crud-operations-with-mongoose), as well as [`populate()`](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html). Also read the [models page](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html#constructing-documents), which goes over using the function `create()` instead of `new` and `save()` for making documents.
