# Week 9 Homework

The homeworks and readings below are intended to prepare you for the next day's lectures. Please complete them first.

If you have any remaining time, please complete/review the exercises from dawn and dusk lectures. You can also review the morning drills.

Please refer to the [Instructions for Submitting Homework](/how-to/homework-submission.md).

## Day 1

1. In preparation for tomororw, please read the Rails Guide on [The Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) -- Sections [1](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#what-is-the-asset-pipeline-questionmark) & [2](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#in-production).
2. We recommend you document 3+ outstanding bugs/feature-requests/enhancements in your vagabond app, using [Github Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). It's good practice, and it will make it easier to pick up where you left off. Make sure to include:
  - How to reproduce the bug ("As a user, I visit page, scroll down...")
  - Specific error message(s)
  - Specific line numbers
  - Priority Level -- 0,1,2,3,4...? (see [examples](https://bugs.opera.com/help/issueTypes.html))
  - Screenshots, Labels, Assignee, etc (optional)
