## Day 3

*Homework has a lot of parts today. We've added some rough time requirement estimates to help you plan.*

1. **Reading**: *15 minutes* When a web browser displays a page, it's not just showing the contents of an HTML file. It also creates a structure that JavaScript can interact with. This structure is called the Document Object Model (DOM). Unlike the HTML file, the DOM can change over time -- and we can change it with JavaScript! The DOM is vitally important for dynamic web pages where elements are added, removed, or changed over time. **Read this [brief introduction to the DOM](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/dom/tutorials/introduction).**

1. **Activity**: *45 minutes* Open the Chrome dev tools with `Cmd` + `Opt` + `i`, and find the Elements tab.
    <img src="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/inspect-styles/imgs/elements-panel.png" alt="Chrome dev tools elements panel screenshot" width="500px">
    * You'll be learning some new ways to edit sites in Chrome. You can make changes to the Developer Guide sections listed below, the site you worked on this afternoon, or a live website you visit often. If you come up with something you like, you can share a screenshot on slack!
    * Try out features from Chrome's [Developer Guide on Editing the DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/inspect-styles/edit-dom), up to and including the "Edit DOM nodes and attributes" section.  
    * Try  out features from the Developer guide on [Editing Styles](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/inspect-styles/edit-styles), up to and including the "Add a new property declaration" section.  


1. **DUE TONIGHT**: *60 minutes* Fork and clone the [function drills lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/function-lab). Attempt at least `sillySum`, `isPrime`, and `filter`.  Add your solutions to the `functions.js` file, and follow the normal homework pull request workflow to submit. Don't forget to add a comment to the pull request indicating comfort and completeness!

Please use any remaining time to complete and review the exercises from today:

* [Bootstrap CSS Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/bootstrap-boilerplate) - [Solution](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/bootstrap-boilerplate/tree/solution)
