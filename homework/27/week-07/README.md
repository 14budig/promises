# Week 7 Homework

The homeworks and readings below are intended to prepare you for the next day's lectures. Please complete them first.

If you have any remaining time, please complete/review the exercises from dawn and dusk lectures. You can also review the morning drills.

Please refer to the [Instructions for Submitting Homework](/how-to/homework-submission.md).


## Day 1


1. Finish up [Username Generator Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/username_generator) through Level 3 and submit a pull request according to the instructions for submittig homework liked above.
1. Read [OOP in Ruby](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/tree/master/04-ruby-rails/ruby-oop/27/oop-reading.md) and try to follow along with the code.  We'll go over Ruby OOP tomorrow.  Pay special attention to the following questions:
   - What is a class?
   - What is the basic Ruby syntax for creating a class and an instance?
   - What is the difference between an instance variable and a class variable?
   - What is the difference between an instance method and a class method?
   - What is inheritance?


## Day 2

1. Tomorrow we begin using Ruby on Rails, a Ruby framework that will help us develop web applications! To get yourself prepared for that introduction, please read and follow along with chapters 1-4 of the [rails getting started guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).Pay special attention to the following questions:
  * What are the guiding principles of Ruby on Rails?
  * What does the terminal command `rails new blog` do?
  * What's the big deal about Models, Views, and Controllers? For more on that[]


2. Finish the [Monster OOP lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/monster-oop) and make a pull request to submit your work. Try the stretches if you have time, but they're not required.
3. (OPTIONAL!) Want more OO practice? Try out this [Wheel Of Fortune lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/wheel_of_fortune)!




## Day 3

1. **Read** sections 1-3 and 5-8 of the [ActiveRecord Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html).
2. **Submit** homework.md from [your blog app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/rails_simple_blog) as a pull request.
3. **Stretch**: repeat the work completed on the blog app once more with instructions - time yourself. Then complete the blog app a third time without instructions and aim to finish it faster! See how well you do!

Please use any remaining time to review the exercises from today.


## Day 4

2. Friday Review Prep
    - **Complete** the [Week 7 Self-Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iRvM5F-4DqcsaNyI2WCBD2mXeLxlVPgUytRip_5_Iz4/viewform?edit_requested=true) and identify 2 topics you want to review tomorrow
    - **Ask and/or upvote** 3 questions on [QuestionCookie](http://www.questioncookie.com/wdi-27-28-w7-review).
1. From this afternoon's [partials and helpers lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/rails_partials_helpers), **refactor** at least one instance of each step in the “steps to refactor.” For example, you don’t need to find *every* `<a></a>` tag and refactor to `link_to`, but you need to do at least one.
2. Today we focused on writing queries and making partials but we did not talk about the controllers that employ these queries. **Look closely** at [this controller](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/fashion_conference_app/blob/solution-with-views/conference_app/app/controllers/speakers_controller.rb) for examples of using some of the queries we used this morning.
3. For review, **complete level 1 (Deep in the CRUD) and level 2 (Models) of the [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/) tutorial**. If you're enjoying macabre humor, strange theme song, and pace of that tutorial, feel free to finish it. The final three sections cover views, controllers, and routes and could also serve as good review.

  *Suggestion*: watch the videos at slightly accelerated speed (up to 2x) if they feel slow to you. When you get to the exercises, refer to this [pdf of the slides](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/blob/master/homework/27/week-07/docs/Rails-For-Zombies-Slides.pdf) if you get stuck. Only review the video when you get really stuck (it's time consuming to find the exact right piece of the video). Take notes as you work to make sure concepts stick!


Please use any remaining time to complete and review the rest of the exercises from today.
