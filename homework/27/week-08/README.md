## Day 1

1. To prep for tomorrow's lessons, **read:**
  * [This overview of sessions and cookies](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/sessions-cookies-and-authentication) in Ruby on Rails.
  * Sections 5 (Sessions) and 6 (Cookies) from this [Rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#session) about controllers.
2. To review today's morning module **read** the [migrations and associations readme](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/blob/master/04-ruby-rails/migrations-and-associations/27/README.md#activerecord-associations). For your own use, jot down answers to:
  * When should I edit schema.rb?
  * When is it OK to edit a migration file?
  * If `Squid has_many :arms` and an `Arm belongs_to :squid` then which table has a foreign_key? (the arm_id or squid_id column)
2. **Complete** the [homework portion of the Pet Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/rails_validations_errors/blob/master/homework.md) and **submit a pull request** of your work. Make sure to work on the base challenges first and reach for the stretches if you have time.
3. **Complete** the  [many-to-many challenges](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/blob/master/04-ruby-rails/migrations-and-associations/27/many_to_many_challenges.md) from the migrations and associations lesson this morning.

Please use any remaining time to review exercises/drills from the day.


## Day 2

1. Reading : Rails Guides
 * [Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) guide, sections 1 and 2. 
 * [Association Basics](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html) guide, sections 1 and 2. Pay particular attention to reviewing `has_many`, `belongs_to` and `has_many` `through`. The rest of section 2 covers other associations you will see in real-world Rails apps. [Self joins](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#self-joins), for example, create associations between two instances of the same model - like two users being friends).  #friends
 * Start reading the [Active Record Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html) guide. You'll finish this tomorrow night.
 
2. Finish [Library app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/public_library_app) at least once - **part 1 only** (we'll do part 2 during the day tomorrow). **Submit a pull request** of your favorite branch.
