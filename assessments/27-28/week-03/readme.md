1. A user fills out a form and hits the "submit" button. List at least 3 things that will happen in the browser and/or server in the next few moments.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

3. Fill in the following grid of RESTful Routes (assume that itâ€™s for an ordering system):

  | CRUD Action | HTTP Verb (Method) | URL Path (Endpoint) |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | READ (all) |  |  |
  | CREATE |  | `/api/orders` |
  | READ (one) |  |  |
  | UPDATE | PATCH or PUT |  |
  | DELETE |  |  |

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

4. Briefly describe the purpose of each of the following files/directories in our Express projects:

  **server.js**

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  **package.json**

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  **node_modules/**

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  **models/food_truck.js**

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  **public/scripts/app.js**

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  **views/index.html**

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

5. Jimmy has an awesome Express app running his business at http://www.jimmysworld.com. Now Jimmy wants his site to include an API that exposes his employee's contact information to developers. For example, a request to `/api/employees/2` should respond with a JSON object containing the contact information for Suzy the Sales Manager (id, name, email address, title). Help Jimmy add a route to his server-side application code that responds with the desired data:

  app.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, function (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) {

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

  });

6. Write a function called `wordToPigLatin()` that takes a single word as an argument and returns the Pig Latin translation. Here are some examples to get you started:

  ```js
  wordToPigLatin('happy');
  //=> 'appyhay'

  wordToPigLatin('duck');
  //=> 'uckday'

  wordToPigLatin('banana')
  //=> 'ananabay'
  ```

  **Bonus:** If a capitalized word is passed as an argument into `wordToPigLatin`, ensure that the returned string is also capitalized properly (e.g. `wordToPigLatin('Banana') //=> 'Ananabay'`)
